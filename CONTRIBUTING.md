# Contributing
One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions on GitHub issues, either for bringing new ideas to discussion or reporting bugs, communicate with the community first so that you don’t start coding things that are already being coded or changes that aren’t suitable to the  project.

## Fork and Pull Requests
Fork the repository and then create a branch related with the issue that you’re working on. It’s a good practice to open a pull request right off the bat with its name prepend with **[WIP]**, then other contributors could easily track its progress. When your work is done, just rename it, removing the **[WIP]** and it will be ready for be reviewed.

We only accept PRs to the **main** branch.

## Practices to consider when coding
* Care about the project’s code style, you should keep the current one, please don’t try to innovate on this matter. If you have some suggestion about it, please open an issue and it will be discussed.
* Create/update unit tests that guarantee that your logic works and won’t be broken with future changes.
* Do not format entire code files that already exist.
